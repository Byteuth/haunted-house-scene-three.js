# Three.js Haunted House Scene

Uses **Three.js** for creating a haunted house environment, focusing on the application of various textures and lighting techniques.

## Textures and Materials

- Color, ARM, Normal, Alpha, Ambient Occlusion, and Displacement maps are used for different surfaces like the floor, walls, roof, bushes, and graveyard.
- These textures add detailed effects such as bumpiness (normal maps),transparency (alpha maps), surface height variations (displacement maps), and shadow effects (ambient occlusion maps).
- Sky material*
- Fog*

## Ghost Lights and Shadows
Three ghosts are represented as **point lights** with distinct colors and moving patterns, casting dynamic shadows throughout the scene. These point lights interact with the environment, creating shadows on the ground and the house.

## Performance Optimization
- Textures are optimized by using **WebP format** instead of PNG, reducing load times and improving rendering performance.
